OMERO.webtagging
================

This is composed of two tools: [autotag](autotag/README.rst) and
[tagsearch](tagsearch/README.rst).

Requirements
============

As Python 2 has now reached end-of-life, OMERO 5.6 now
requires Python 3. With release 3.1.0 of both autotag and
tagsearch, the following are now required. To use autotag
and tagsearch on older OMERO systems (running Python 2),
please use versions older than 3.1.0.

* Python 3.5 or later
* omero-web 5.6 or later
* django 1.11 or later

These plugins were developed originally with the
support of [Micron Advanced Bioimaging Unit](https://micronoxford.com/)
funded by the Wellcome Trust Strategic Award 091911,
and [Open Microscopy](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/).

Continued development was supported by [The Laboratory
of Systems Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/research-program/) and
[Research Computing, Harvard Medical School](https://it.hms.harvard.edu/our-services/research-computing).
